# PRODUCT-CARD
The project is a dynamic and interactive product card designed for e-commerce platforms. The primary feature of this product card is an "Add to Cart" button, which allows users to seamlessly add products to their shopping cart. This component is essential for any online shopping experience, providing a user-friendly and efficient way to pick items. I use HTML & CSS to build the project.
